Step one on trackRC pi

Wiring up a simple voltage divider to support using the 5V HC-SR04 ultrasonic range finder to be read by the pi

Wired up a harness with 3 1Kohm resitors to make a voltage dividor.

Black lead has a 'straight through' 0Ohm path, from the end without the red collar to the end with the red collar.

The white lead has a 2kOhm path to gnd, and a 1kOhm path through (designed to be used on echo pin)
